# Generation Commands

## Using the Generate Command

The `Generate` command is the core feature of GooseCode, creating visual snippets as you navigate through your codebase.

<br/>

## How to Generate

- **Keyboard shortcut**: `Alt+Cmd+G` (Mac) or `Alt+Ctrl+G` (Windows/Linux)
- **Context menu**: Right-click > GooseCode > Generate

<br/>

## What Happens

When you trigger Generate:

1. GooseCode analyzes the symbol under your cursor
2. Finds definitions or references
3. Creates visual snippets showing the code relationship
4. Navigates to the target location

## Generation Strategies

- **Swimlane**: Organizes snippets by file into columns - great for understanding inter-file dependencies
- **Linear**: Arranges snippets in a linear sequence

<br/>

## Tips

- Works similarly to VS Code's "Go to Definition" but with visual output
- Useful for tracing code paths and understanding dependencies
