# Code Sources

## Initializing a Code Source

On initialization a `.goose` configuration file will be created in the workspace root. 
This is necessary for GooseCode to continue to work when workspaces are moved or shared.

## Disabling a Code Source

When a code source is disabled, the `.goose` file will be deleted, and no longer resolvable via the GooseCode app.

## Version Control
We recommend adding the .goose file to your version control when working across machines or sharing projects.
