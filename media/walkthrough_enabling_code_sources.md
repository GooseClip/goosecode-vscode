# Enabling Code Sources

## What are Code Sources?

Code sources are workspaces that have been configured to work with GooseCode. Each enabled workspace can be visualized and navigated in the GooseCode app.

<br/>

## How to Enable a Code Source

1. Open the GooseCode view in the VS Code Activity Bar (click the GooseCode icon)
2. Find the **Code Sources** section
3. Hover over a workspace folder
4. Click the **toggle button** to enable it

<br/>

## What Happens When Enabled

- A `.goose` configuration file is created in the workspace root
- The workspace becomes available in the GooseCode app
- You can now use GooseCode features with files in that workspace

<br/>

## Managing Code Sources

- **Enable**: Click the toggle to activate
- **Disable**: Click again to deactivate (removes `.goose` file)
- **Refresh**: Use the refresh button to rescan workspaces
