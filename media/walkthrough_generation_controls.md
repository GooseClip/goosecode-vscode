# About Generation Sessions

## What is a Session?

When you first use the `Generate` command, a **session** is started. A session groups related code navigation steps together.

<br/>

## Session Controls

From the Activity Bar's "Active Session" view, you can:

- **Regenerate**: Refresh the current visualization
- **Step through**: Navigate through generation history
- **Save**: Preserve the session for later
- **Discard**: Clear the current session

<br/>

## Session Behavior

- Sessions persist while you navigate
- New generations add to the current session
- Starting a new exploration creates a new session

<br/>

## Best Practices

- Use sessions to trace through complex code paths
- Save sessions for documentation or later review
- Discard sessions when starting a new investigation
