# Connecting GooseCode

## Steps to Connect

1. Open the GooseCode application on your device
2. Create a new project or open an existing one
3. Navigate to the IDE control pane
4. Enter the connection details from VS Code settings:
   - **Host**: Your machine's IP address (or `localhost` for same machine)
   - **Port**: Default is `60053`
   - **Password**: Found in VS Code GooseCode settings

<br/>

## Finding Your Connection Details

Open VS Code settings and search for "GooseCode" to find:
- Port number
- Password (auto-generated on first run)
- Localhost-only setting

<br/>

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the GooseCode extension server is running (green status in activity bar)
- Check that the port is not blocked by a firewall
- For cross-device connections, disable "Localhost Only" in settings
